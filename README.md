## 🚀 Course Overview

This repository contains all materials for the course **Machine Learning in Finance** (ADE + FAB, 2nd year).  
All notebooks run directly in **Google Colab** — no installation required.

To work on any notebook, students must open it in Colab and create a personal editable copy:

**Colab menu → File → Save a copy in Drive**

## 🗂️ Repository Structure


Please do not redistribute materials outside the academic context without permission.


Each folder will contain Google Colab–ready notebooks and additional resources.

## ▶️ How to Use the Notebooks (for Students)

1. Open the notebook using its **Colab link** (posted below each section).  
2. Once Colab loads the file, select:  
   **File → Save a copy in Drive**  
   This creates *your* working version.  
3. Work **only** on your Drive copy — not on the GitHub original.
